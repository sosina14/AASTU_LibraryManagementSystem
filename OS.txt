        Process and Threads

Process is program in the execution.
        is an active intitiy

program is sequence of instructions defined to perform some task.
        is a passive intity



program counter: contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched
stack -> store temporary data (local varable , function , return data)
heap -> is a memory dynamiclly allocate during the process run time.
data control -> contains global varable

        Type of Process

1, sequential => executed sequential fasion and  at most one process is being executed
2, concurrent => Multiprocessing
    2.1. True concurent 
            -> Two or more processes are executed simultaneously 
            -> in a multiprocessor environment
            -> Supports real parallelism
    2.2. Apparent concurent
            -> Two or more processes are executed in parallel 
            -> in a uniprocessor environment by switching from one process to another
            -> Supports pseudo parallelism
                    i.e. the fast switching among processes gives illusion of parallelism

Process to start
    1, os system by it self
        1.1. foreground -> user and computer
        1.2. background -> the os system
    2, Execution of a process creation system call by a running process.
    3, user opening a file
    4,Initiation of a batch job
